### Executive Summary

Global warming is changing our climate resulting to longer and more frequent droughts, stronger storms and rising sea levels. The change in climate ultimately affects our daily lives resulting to health concerns, destructive weather and food security concerns being the most pressing effect. According to the United Nations, climate change is the defining issue of our time and we are at the defining moment to address this (United Nations, n.d.). Scientists has been vocal about the negative consequences of the increase in global temperature since the 1970s and has been pushing for environmental reforms ever since. It was in the 2000s that we see an increase of media attention to this issue with the introduction of Al Gore's documentary, An Inconvenient Truth and 20th Century Fox's apocalyptic film The Day After Tomorrow. Since then, conversations and efforts on global warming and climate change has moved from the scientific community to the realm of politics, media and corporate social responsibility. With all these attention and awareness to climate change, we want to understand if we are making a progress in addressing this pressing environmental concert

To analyze our progress in solving the climate change issue, we have analyzed data from Global Surface Summary of the Day retrieved from Amazon Open Data Registery. We processed data from year 2000-2015 to check if there are improvements in global temperature and climate changes such as rainfall, drought and storms.
